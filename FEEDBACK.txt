FEEDBACK:

-10% late submission.


Your implementation does not demonstrate iterating over the elements of your
    LinkedList data structure. This was a key requirement of the project.
    
For future, show all requested output to avoid an incomplete. 
If you need clarification, ask in appropriate discussion forum.


-3 Incomplete implementation of class Country getNumSupscriptionsForPeriod() method,
   which should use an iterator to traverse the subscriptions 
   as required by project description:
   "Use an iterator in the getNumSupscriptionsForPeriod() method of the Country class. 
   This method should use the iterator to traverse the list of SubscriptionYear elements."


-2 Missing using an iterator in the LinkedList toString() method
   as required by project description.
   This is was straightforward modification. Why exclude it?


-2 Incomplete implementation of class "ListIterator" inside class LinkedList.
	This class should be "private" inner class as required by project description:
"ListIterator

An inner class of LinkedList that is used to traverse the collection of objects in the list..."



-0 Do *not* change method signatures. 
   This includes handling of exceptions, etc.
   Otherwise when I run my own test file, this results in compilation errors,
   which does not allow me to run your implementation and would impact your grade.

   See sample sample output below.
